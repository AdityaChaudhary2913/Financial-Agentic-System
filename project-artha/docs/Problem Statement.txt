Let AI speak to your money
* The Challenge: AI today can answer general financial questions — but not yours. That’s because your financial life is scattered across banks, mutual funds, stocks, and more. Even the most intelligent AI can’t reason meaningfully without structured, secure access to real data. What’s missing is the infrastructure to connect an individual's complete financial footprint to AI in a way that respects privacy, promotes control, and works across platforms.
While MCP (Model Context Protocol) exists in enterprise AI stacks, it has never been meaningfully applied to consumer finance — until now. Fi Money has launched the world’s first consumer-facing personal finance MCP Server — an AI-native infrastructure layer that consolidates, normalises, and structures financial data across 18+ sources, allowing users to connect it securely to any AI model, such as Gemini.
The question is: what can you build with it?
* The Objective: Build an AI-powered agent or experience using Fi’s MCP Server that delivers deeply personalised financial insights to users in a secure, private, and intelligent way. The agents should:
   * Consume structured financial data from Fi’s MCP, including assets, liabilities, net worth, credit scores, EPF, and more.
   * Enable natural-language financial conversations, e.g., “How much money will I have at 40?”, “How’s my net worth growing?”, “Can I afford a ₹50L home loan?”, “Which SIPs underperformed the market?”
   * Use Gemini’s capabilities to understand trends, suggest actions, simulate scenarios, or visualise outcomes.
   * Ensure complete user control; users own their insights and can export or extend the assistant’s capabilities to other models or tools.
   * Go beyond generic budgeting; think AI agents that guide investment strategy, optimise debt, project long-term goals, or detect financial anomalies.
Tech Stack & Guidelines:
   * Use Google AI technologies (Gemini, Vertex AI, Agent Builder, etc.) — this is mandatory.
   * Leverage Fi’s MCP to fetch financial data in a structured JSON format.
   * Your agent can be voice-first, chat-based, mobile-friendly, or API-driven — the choice is yours
